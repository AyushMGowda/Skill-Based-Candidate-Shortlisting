# 🧠 Candidate Skill Matcher

A simple Python GUI project using **Tkinter** that ranks candidates based on how many required job skills they match.

> 💡 Created during my **Summer Training Classes on "Fundamentals of Data Structures using C++"**,  
> where I implemented data structure concepts such as arrays, sorting, and searching in a practical way.
